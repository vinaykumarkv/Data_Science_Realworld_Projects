# Certificate Classifier Streamlit App

A Streamlit-based web application for classifying certificate data using a machine learning model. Users can submit data manually or upload a CSV file for batch processing.

---

## Features

- **Manual Input**: Enter 11 feature values for real-time evaluation.
- **CSV Upload**: Upload a CSV file with 11 columns for batch processing.
- **Download Results**: Get predictions as a downloadable CSV.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinaykumarkv/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
   cd ML_apps/ml_cert_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure the trained model (`certificate_model.pkl`) is in the root directory. If not, train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to:
   [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Usage

### Web UI

1. **Manual Input**:
   - Go to the "Manual Input" tab.
   - Enter 11 feature values (between 0 and 1) in the input fields.
   - Click **Submit Certificate** to see the prediction (Pass/Fail).

2. **CSV Upload**:
   - Go to the "CSV Upload" tab.
   - Upload a CSV file with 11 columns (no headers required).
   - View the results in a table and download the output CSV with predictions.

## Hosting on Streamlit Cloud

1. **Prepare the Repository**:
   - Ensure your GitHub repository contains:
     - `app.py` (the Streamlit app above)
     - `requirements.txt` (updated below)
     - `certificate_model.pkl` (the trained model)
     - Optionally, include `sample.csv` for testing

2. **Sign Up for Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in with your GitHub account.

3. **Deploy the App**:
   - Click "New App" and select your repository, branch, and main file (`app.py`).
   - Streamlit Cloud will automatically install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and deploy the app.
   - Ensure `certificate_model.pkl` is included in the repository, as it’s required for predictions.

4. **Access the App**:
   - Once deployed, you’ll get a URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`) to access the app.

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Check the Streamlit Cloud logs for errors (e.g., missing model file or dependencies).
   - Ensure the model file is not too large for GitHub (use Git LFS if needed).

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication.
- Improve model accuracy.
- Include lightweight OCR for extracting data from image documents.
- Integrate with a database for scheduled certificate classification.
- Add Telegram or email notifications for results.
- Support additional file formats (e.g., Excel).
- Enhance UI/UX with custom Streamlit components.
