# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects** repository!

This repository contains all the **Data Science projects, experiments, and implementations** I’m working on — from basic concepts to complex real-world problem-solving.  
It serves as a single place to track my learning, exploration, and progress in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to explore, experiment, and document everything I learn and build in machine learning.  
Each project represents — realworld business problems, understanding algorithms, experimenting with techniques, optimizing outcomes, and building practical use cases.

This repo will continuously evolve as I explore new ideas, try different models, and integrate math, logic, and programming into hands-on implementations.

##  What You’ll Find Here

- Concept explorations and statistical/ mathematical implementations  
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization experiments  
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation workflows  
- Projects ranging from classical ML to deep learning and automation  
- Case studies and problem-solving exercises with real-world data  

Each subfolder or version documents the journey — from initial understanding to improved iterations.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.11+**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-Learn**, **SciPy**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch** (where applicable)  
- Additional libraries and utilities as experiments evolve

## Learning Focus

- Understanding **how machine learning works under the hood**  - basic to advanced concepts 
- Experimenting with different algorithms and architectures  
- Building end-to-end workflows that automate tasks or make predictions  

The idea is to focus on **learning by doing** — one project at a time.
